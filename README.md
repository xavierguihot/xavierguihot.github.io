## Overview

Version: 1.0.1 - 20171216

My personal page (resume) built with the powerfull d3 library and inspired from
this pretty [info-design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/7990211/Infographic-Design)
by Chen-Wen Liang.

The time line can actually be transposed to anyone's resume by modifying the
json input data file.
